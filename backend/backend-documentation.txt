This is the documentation for the backend part of the twodo application
here we have our backend that we are going to be creating using nest.js
what the fuck is nest.js? I don't know but we shall figure out: All I had to do was type in the command and it generated a bunch of files that I don't really know what they are, we are going to figure it out as we go tho XD
